### What I studied today:
1. Pytorch vs Tensorflow
    - Computatioanl Graph
        - Creating a graph used when computing training & predicting the neural network
        - Define and Run: Tensorflow
        - Define by Run: PyTorch -> Pythonic Code
    - Tensorflow
        - Edge in scalability and Production
    - PyTorch 
        - Adopts the tensor structure from Numpy
        - Auto Gradient
    
2. PyTorch Operations

3. Assignment:
    - Creating a NN model with PyTorch. SO HARD!
