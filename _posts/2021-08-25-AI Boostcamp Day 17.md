### Model
- The building blocks of a PyTorch model, nn.Modules are pythonicly implementable
- Pretrained Model
    - Apply transfer learning
    - Big Data?
        - train FC layer (if the task is similar)
        - train the whole layer 
    - Small Data
        - train only the FC layer

### Pear Session

### Assignments
- Revise code and create custom dataset

### Reflections
- Do not try to do anything after coming back home, when nobody is watching me. You are not going to be productive
