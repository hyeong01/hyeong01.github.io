### What I studied today:
1. Recent Tendency of Using Models
- Using pretrained models to fine-tune on a specific task

2. Saving a Model
- Can either save a the whole model or save only the parameters (smaller model)
- Practice with Code

3. Saving a Checkpoint
- Utilizing the function for saving models, we can create a checkpoint at every iterations

4. Transfer Learning
- Using a pretrained model on a larger dataset and fine-tuning on a specific, smaller dataset to obtain better results
- Freezing: frozing some of the parameters when tuning a pretrained model

5. Monitoring Tools for PyTorch
- [Tensorboard](https://hyeong01.github.io/deep%20learning%20visualization/Basic-Tensorboard-with-Code/)

- Weight and Biases
