### Objective
- Learning how to enhance DL model
- Learning a part of DL pipeline

### Data Description
- Metadata Field, file format

### Discussion
- Way to improving together

### Answer Submission
- File name and answer label in csv
- How to create the answer label file?
    - With python IDLE (the hosts will provide it)
    - Jupyter Notebook

### Questions
- Many data fields.. aside from the image itself. how can I use it? -> The goal is to predict all labels

### Ideas
- The faces in the photo are always in the middle. We can crop it for better performance
- Better to have the result for each classes from different models or at least from a different vector. The suggested class of 0 from 17 with different classes merged into one vector is undesirable
