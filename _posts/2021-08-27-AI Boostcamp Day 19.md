### Ensemble
- Combining multiple models for better performance
- Voting
    - Hard Voting
    - Soft Voting
- Cross Validation
    - The fold should be adequate for training when spliting
    - Stratified K-Fold Cross Validation
- Test Time Augumentation Ensemble
    - Infer different augmentated photos with a train model 
    - get multiple result -> Ensemble
- Hyperparameter Tuning: grid search -> too much resource

### Experiment Toolkits & Tips
- [Tensorboard](https://hyeong01.github.io/deep%20learning%20visualization/Basic-Tensorboard-with-Code/)


### [Peer Session](https://www.notion.so/2021-08-27-6add1b3dc082482d988779548471d04b)

### What did I Do Today
    - Asked people to train model for each task
    - Validated the models other people made
    - Combined the result and submitted
    - Discussed and merged other functions

### Reflections
    - Overall great!
