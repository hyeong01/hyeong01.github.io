    - Takes a sequence of words as input and gives another sequence as an output
    - Composed of Encoder and Decoder
    - Decoder receives 'start of sentence' token at the beginning and gives 'end of sentence' token to end the sequence'
    - Problem? The huge volume of the sequence should be cramped into a netwrok even if the hidden dimension is relatively small + The information from the early sequence disappears! -> need of attention model
