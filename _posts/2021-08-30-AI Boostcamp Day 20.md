### What did I do today
 - Stratified labeling (single person either in train or test dataset)
 - Served transformation package

### What I learned from others
 - Use of augumentation like TTA, cutmix
 - Early stopping
 - Model is almost always about data -> importance of augmentation

### What I should do tomorrow
 - data rearrange -> place wrongly labeled data at the right place manually
 - f1 loss
 - try lots of models

### (Peer Session)[https://www.notion.so/2021-08-30-a3cba5ad040845b4bf0717bb78b41273]

### Reflections
    - Make a plan always!
